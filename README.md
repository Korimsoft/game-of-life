# Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple hobby implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton.
The intent of this application is to learn basics of Python programming language
and creating GUI applications in Python (tkinter).

## Before the fun starts

The application depends on Tkinter and Numpy. You would have to install them first. 
* Tkinter: On *Ubuntu, run `apt install python3-tk`
* Numpy: `pip3 install numpy`

## Running the application

Go to the src folder and simply launch life.py (don't forget to modify the execute privileges)

After starting the application, there is an empty board. Activate some cells by clicking on them.
Then hit start.
You can add cells also when the simulation is running.
