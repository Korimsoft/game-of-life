# Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple hobby implementation of Conway's Game of Life cellular automaton.
The intent of this application is to learn basics of Python programming language
and creating GUI applications in Python (tkinter).

Soon, I would like to extend the application to a more general cellular automaton, i.e.
* Strategy pattern for checking Moore neighborhood/von Neumann neighborhood
* Strategy pattern for checking boundary conditions

Eye candy/polishing the graphics
* Animation of dying/reviving cells
* Color scheme that will reflect the cell state (for more general celular automata)
* PyQT library instead of tkinter
